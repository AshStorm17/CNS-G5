# CNS-G5

## About
We are Group5. This repository has been created for our CS431 course, 

We have made a Bank, ATM model that is used for user transactions and maintainence.


## Project Overview
The project involves developing two main components: an ATM client (atm) and a Bank server (bank), which will communicate securely over a network. The system is designed to allow customers to perform transactions such as deposits and withdrawals securely. The ATM client interacts with the Bank server to update or query customer account balances. Security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity during transactions.
